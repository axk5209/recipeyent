# Recipeyent Frontend
### *Frontend of fun recipe-sharing website. Built with React JS (Redux, Hooks, Material UI)*

#### Users can create, review, and save different recipes and follow other users' content.

#### The src folder contains code for different pages in the platform: the Login Screen, Landing Page, Recipe Creation Form, User Dashboard, etc.

***One unconventional feature I integrated is "tags" for each recipe instead of traditional descriptions. Users can enter tags that they think pertain to recipes, and the most popular tags are displayed next to the recipe's name. Instead of a creator-defined descriptions, tags can be crowdsourced, which enables better accuracy when displaying recipe information.***
