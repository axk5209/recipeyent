# Recipeyent Frontend
### *Frontend of fun recipe-sharing website. Built with React JS (Redux, Hooks, and Material UI).*

#### Users can create, review, and save different recipes. They can also follow other users to prioritize their content
#### The src folder contains code for different pages in the platform: the Login Form, Signup Form, Landing Page, Recipe Creating Form, etc.

One unconventional feature I integrated is **tags** for each recipe instead of traditional descriptions. Users can enter tags that they think pertain to recipes, and the most popular tags are displayed next to the recipe's name. Instead of a creator-defined descriptions, tags can be crowdsourced, which enables better accuracy when displaying recipe information.
